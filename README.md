# BusinessSimulationEngine
An engine for simulating your own businesses, inspired by a school project

As practical component for a school project in my final year I choose to build a 
turn based business simulation. I wrote the entire project in VB.net and, because that's my main language and it had to be reviewed by my teacher, in dutch.
The business simulation was mend for students of around 14-17 years of age with an economical profile. The game is turn based and has a lot of build in modules containing a lot of real world scenarios and options. It also included detailed presentation of the dataside of the business. The way the data was presented is similar to the way they learn it in class.
A few things about this project however weren't perfect yet. 
I for example also wanted to support multiple businesses and wasn't satisfied with the architecture of the engine. The engine also didn't allow for easy customization or plugin actions.
